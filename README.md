# angular-trace-log
You will get a log message each time a controller, service, factory or directive will be registered or called. You only need to include the script.

You may use this for learning or logging purposes. The only thing todo is adding

    <script src="angular-trace-log.js"></script>

below the angularjs include but above your own Javascript files.
